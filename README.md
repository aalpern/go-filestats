A very simple utility to generate some statistics about files on
disk - calculating disk usage per year based on file modification
dates.

Used to generate the chart in this blog entry about my
[photo backups and their data growth](https://monster.partyhat.co/article/photo-backup-evolution-2019-edition/).

Status: Very much work in progress.
